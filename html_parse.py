unicode_string = u'<a href="http://cs61a.org/quiz/quiz02/">Quiz 2</a> is posted, due Monday 10/12 &#64; 11:59pm (but you should really just do it today or tomorrow).\n\n<b>You must work alone</b>, but you may talk to the course staff. You may use any course materials, including an interpreter, course videos, slides, and readings. Please <b>do not</b> discuss these specific questions with your classmates, and <b>do not</b> scour the web for answers or post your answers online.\n\nYour submission will be graded automatically for correctness. Your implementations <b>do not</b> need to be efficient, as long as they are correct. We will apply additional correctness tests as well as the ones provided. Passing these tests does not guarantee a perfect score.\n\n<b>Asking Questions:</b> If you believe you need clarification on a question, <b>make a private post</b> on Piazza. Please do not post publicly about the quiz contents. If the staff discovers a problem with the quiz or needs to clarify a question, we will email the class via Piazza. You can also come to office hours to ask questions about the quiz or any other course material, but no answers or hints will be provided in office hours.\n\n<b>Changes:</b>\n<ul><li>10/09, 6:30 PM - the unnecessary <code>minted</code> attribute was removed.</li></ul>\n\n#pin'
